# The Avilas Custom PCB
This project is for the custom wedding cake topper for Crystal and Chris. The topper is going to be a custom PCB that displays "The Avilas" in an array of individually addressable SMD LEDs that animate like if it was being signed. I want to prioritize unsing the MCB mill (in my classroom) for prototypes and then order a professional version from JLC PCB/EasyEDA/PCB Way.   

Hardware Requirements
- Atmel ATtiny85 MCU throughole but preferably SMD
- Individually addressable SMD LED's
- Low-profile power supply (rechargeable lipo battery)

Software Requirements
- Documented on Overleaf
- Programmed in C/C++
- VSCode with Platform IO
- PCB designed using KiCAD

Version Control and Project Management Requirements
- Git/Github for version sontrol
- Github's integrated Kanban feature
